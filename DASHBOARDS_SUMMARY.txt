================================================================================

✅ Chrome/Edge (latest)
✅ Firefox (latest)
✅ Safari (latest)
✅ Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

================================================================================
                          PERFORMANCE
================================================================================

FRONTEND:
  • Single API call on component mount
  • Tab switching is instant (no API calls)
  • Responsive grid layouts
  • Optimized re-renders with proper state management

BACKEND:
  • Efficient database queries with indexed lookups
  • Minimal data processing
  • Clean data grouping logic
  • Can handle hundreds of jobs/applications efficiently

================================================================================
                          SECURITY
================================================================================

✅ JWT Authentication Required
   - Both endpoints require valid JWT token
   - Invalid tokens receive 401 Unauthorized

✅ User Data Isolation
   - Server filters queries by current user ID
   - Users can only see their own applications/jobs
   - No data leakage between users

✅ Schema Validation
   - Pydantic validates all responses
   - Type-safe data structures
   - No invalid data returned to clients

================================================================================
                          FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
================================================================================

POTENTIAL ADDITIONS:
  • Search and filter functionality
  • Pagination for large datasets
  • Export to CSV/PDF
  • Real-time notifications
  • Advanced sorting options
  • Analytics and statistics
  • Bulk actions (accept/reject multiple)
  • Saved job templates
  • Rating and reviews
  • Performance graphs

================================================================================
                          KNOWN LIMITATIONS
================================================================================

• No pagination (loads all data at once)
  → Solution: Can be added with limit/offset parameters

• No search/filter
  → Solution: Can be added with query parameters

• No real-time updates
  → Solution: Can add WebSocket support

• Tab switching data is client-side only
  → Note: This is intentional for performance

• No data export
  → Solution: Can be added as feature

================================================================================
                          VERIFICATION STEPS
================================================================================

1. BACKEND VERIFICATION:
   • Python syntax check: ✅ PASSED
   • No import errors
   • Endpoints accessible at /api/jobs/dashboard/*

2. FRONTEND VERIFICATION:
   • Routes added to App.jsx
   • Components import correctly
   • No TypeScript/JSX errors

3. INTEGRATION VERIFICATION:
   • Dashboard.jsx links to new routes
   • Protected routes work correctly
   • Authentication flow intact
